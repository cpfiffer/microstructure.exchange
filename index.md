The Microstructure Exchange is a virtual academic market microstructure research seminar of indefinite length, intended to continue the sharing of ideas between researchers.

Speakers will be invited to present their work over Zoom. Seminars will last 45 minutes with questions asked at designated break points during the talk and a 15 minute Q&A session at the end of the session that will be organized by a moderator.

The first speakers are well-established in the field. To ensure that junior researchers also have ample presentation opportunities, we plan to also reserve presentation slots for tenure-track faculty and senior PhD students.

## Upcoming talk

__Abstract__: We analyze how information processing power and data abundance affect speculators' search for predictors. Speculators optimally search for a predictor whose signal-to-noise ratio exceeds an endogenous threshold. Greater computing power raises this threshold, and therefore price informativeness, because it reduces the cost of search. In contrast, data abundance can lower this threshold because (i) it intensifies competition among speculators, which reduces the benefit of finding a good predictor and (ii) it increases the total expected cost of finding a predictor. In the former (latter) case, price informativeness increases (decreases) with data abundance. We present additional testable implications of these effects.
