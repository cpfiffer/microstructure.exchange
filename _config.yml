  #abstract: "Investors act as a liquidity back-stop in the corporate bond market. By providing liquidity, investors help ease dealers’ balance sheet constraints, especially during market stress. During the March 2020 Dash-for-Cash, in bonds where investors stopped providing liquidity, transaction costs rose by 38%. We find the composition of types of liquidity providers — rather than just their presence shapes trading costs. Dealers relying on flexible-mandate investors, such as hedge funds, are more resilient to liquidity shocks. Dealers offer discounts to investors for past liquidity services to maintain liquidity provider networks. These discounts represent two-thirds of relationship discounts."
