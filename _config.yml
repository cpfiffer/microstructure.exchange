  #abstract: "In a dynamic model of large traders who manage inventory risk, we show that a daily market closure coordinates liquidity. Some length of closure is welfare-improving relative to 24/7 trade, as the coordination of liquidity improves allocative efficiency, fully offsetting the costs of the closure. A long closure is optimal for traders in small markets, while traders in large markets would benefit from extending trading hours to near 24/7. A calibration of our model to several large equity exchanges that have proposed extending trading hours suggests that implementing such proposals would benefit traders."
