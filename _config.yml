 # abstract: "Why do customers in OTC markets form long-term relationships with dealers? Using a unique data set from a European investment bank containing information on customer trades, the bank's client management system and bank employees, we find that the dealer quotes repeat customers substantially lower bid-ask spreads. In turn, customers are incentivized to abstain from covertly obtaining additional quotes, solving a moral hazard problem. We then leverage employee-level data to show that the organizational structure of investment banks is designed such that relationship commitments are enforced internally. Salespeople, a specific category of bank employees, serve as intermediaries between customers and bank traders across multiple asset classes. Our findings suggest that OTC markets should be understood through the lens of repeated games, where cooperation and reputation are important."
