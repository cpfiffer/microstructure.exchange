  abstract: "The recent surge in retail option trading has sparked concerns about trading motives and significant losses. To evaluate these concerns, we offer the first trader-level analysis of modern retail option trading by introducing a novel data set of $15 billion in retail stock and option trades. Option trades constitute over one-third of all trades, are concentrated in a few underlyings, especially the S&P 500 index, and are dominated by short-term purchases. Surprisingly, option trades incur relatively small losses despite wide bid-ask spreads. Retail investors use options to participate in high-priced underlyings, with limited evidence of leverage or skewness-seeking in realized trade returns. While our average retail investor is relatively sophisticated, results remain robust across investor subsamples."
