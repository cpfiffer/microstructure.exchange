  abstract: "Although supply shocks are central to identifying demand elasticity in other areas of economics, the asset pricing literature has relied on demand-side instruments. We fill this gap by exploiting a unique shock to shares outstanding: the 2016 Tick Size Pilot. While treatment and control firms announced similar levels of repurchases, treatment firms ultimately bought 20% fewer shares due to unforeseen conflicts between the pilot and repurchase regulations. The random assignment of stocks also allows us to account for price spillovers. We estimate a price multiplier of 2.01 and show that households and investment advisors (e.g., hedge funds) absorb most of supply shocks."
