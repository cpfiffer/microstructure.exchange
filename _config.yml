  abstract: "Passive investment strategies that trade at market close have incurred high transaction fees charged by the primary exchanges. Investment banks undercut the exchanges by executing client orders at close prices set on the exchanges yet charging lower fees. While providing liquidity, banks trade on the order flow information. Using a quasiexperimental shock – an NYSE close auction fee cut – we find that banks’ trading activities improve the informativeness of close prices and reduce the cost of passive investment strategies. To explain this finding, we propose a model where dual trading improves price discovery. A bank contributes to price discovery by trading on the informativeness of the orders it receives relative to the market. The implications of our model apply generally to scenarios with multiple trading venues where venue operators trade on order flow data. As an application of our results, the common practice of trading on retail order flow information could potentially improve price discovery."
