  abstract: "We document low cross-sectional correlations between high-frequency market maker (MM) inventory positions, suggesting poor risk sharing. Using a unique data set on Canadian futures markets, a simple inventory cost estimate is 300% above the optimal benchmark. Our model explains how heterogeneity in MM inventories impacts their liquidity provision in time-priority markets. Depth is maximized if large inventory MMs arrive later in the queue. Random queue positions allow us to cleanly distinguish between inventory frictions and adverse selection using quote sizes. In our sample, both frictions are equally large and imperfect risk sharing explain up to 8% of depth variability."
