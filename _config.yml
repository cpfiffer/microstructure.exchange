  abstract: "In the context of financial markets, which trading mechanisms are optimal for revenue or efficiency or some combination of the two? Do they resemble institutions we see in practice? How should trade be structured if there is no adverse selection among traders about asset payoffs? If there is adverse selection? If traders are heterogeneous? If there are multiple assets? If there are dynamics? Which mechanisms offer guarantees of efficiency that are robust to adverse selection? Which information structures do robust mechanisms gaurd against? How well do prices aggregate private information when the trading mechanism is endogenous? I investigate these questions for a canonical model setting in finance market microstructure: large traders; quadratic holding costs; private endowments."
