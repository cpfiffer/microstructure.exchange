  abstract: "We study the contribution of AI-generated reference prices to intraday price discovery in markets with infrequent trading. Using corporate bond transactions and MarketAxess CP+ quotes, we find that CP+ is more informative about future trade prices than the last trade. Regression analysis shows that CP+ quote updates are systematically related to market-wide movements in bond, equity, and options markets, as well as bond-specific non-public information from the RFQ process. CP+ provides broad coverage across bonds and trading days. Its contribution to price discovery exhibits a bell-shaped relationship with liquidity and increases under market uncertainty. Following a trade report, CP+ updates quickly in the direction of the trade. We show that this can limit its contribution during periods driven by large transitory price shocks."
