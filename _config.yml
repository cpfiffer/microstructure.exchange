  # abstract: "Liquidity providers (LPs) on decentralized exchanges pay a fixed transaction cost (gas price) whenever they update their positions. Different economies of scale across LPs lead in equilibrium to the fragmentation of liquidity supply between low- and high-fee pools. Using data on liquidity updates from Uniswap, we document that while high-fee pools attract 56% of liquidity supply, they only execute 35% of trading volume. Low-fee pools cater to large (institutional) LPs, who update positions frequently in response to large trading volume. In contrast, small (retail) LPs converge to high-fee pools, trading off lower execution probabilities against a smaller liquidity management cost."
