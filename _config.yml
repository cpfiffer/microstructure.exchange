  # abstract: "Trading outside national securities exchanges is often collectively referred to as dark trading. Nonetheless, it encompasses ATSs and non-ATSs, each with distinct legal and economic characteristics. ATSs, unlike non-ATSs, are legally classified and treated as 'exchanges' and act as agents in executing trades. We examine two exogenous and identical transparency shocks and demonstrate that transparency tends to yield contrasting outcomes regarding market quality for ATSs and non-ATSs. Transparency unambiguously attracts more orders and improves execution speeds. However, it notably diminishes other market quality metrics on ATSs, while remarkably enhancing them on non-ATSs. Our results also contribute to an ongoing debate about the accuracy of (Boehmer, Jones, Zhang, & Zhang, 2021)’s (BJZZ) method in identifying retail trades. We offer new explanations for the disparities between BJZZ’s conclusions and its critiques. Finally, our paper is closely tied to two recent SEC proposals aimed at enhancing order execution disclosure and improving retail trading landscape."
