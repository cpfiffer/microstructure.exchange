  #abstract: "A Grossman-Stiglitz type model is proposed to solve two variance premium/VIX puzzles: Why do investors pay to hold realized variance risk, instead of earn a premium? And, why do they pay more in post-crisis months? The model consists of three periods. Agents are identical initially, then become heterogenous due to nontraded risk shocks and trade to hedge, and finally consume payoffs. The equilibrium provides a novel perspective on the time series of VIX, S&P500 returns, and SPY trading. The long time series, 1993 through 2024, includes several crises. These crises share a common pattern, which the model can generate endogenously."
