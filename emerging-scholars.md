# The Microstructure Exchange: Emerging Scholars

The Microstructure Exchange (website) is soliciting papers in market microstructure from junior researchers and PhD students to be presented in a series of Tuesday online seminars in July 2020.

The main goal of the seminars is to provide feedback to early researchers who have difficulty promoting their work due to the ongoing pandemic.

A large group of market structure scholars will review the submitted papers and choose four for presentation. The seminars will be one hour, with 30 minutes for presentation, 15 minutes for a discussant, and 15 minutes for Q&A.

Please submit your paper [here](https://www.research.net/r/TME-2020).

**Submission deadline**: May 11, 2020

**Notification of acceptance**: June 8, 2020

### Submission Guidelines

All papers must be original and must have not been accepted for publication, presented, or accepted for presentation at a major conference (e.g., the AFA, EFA, or WFA). Submissions must be anonymous and in PDF format.

Preference will be given to submissions, for which all authors are junior researchers. Since it is difficult to provide an exhaustive definition of "a junior researcher," we leave it up to the submitters to self-select into this category and to the program committee to agree or disagree.
